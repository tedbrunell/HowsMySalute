    	<p>This is a simple computer vision program to try to determine if someone's "salute" meets U.S. Army standards. Army TC3-21.5 covers the requirements for a proper salute.</p>

    	<p> From Army TC 3-21.5:</p>

    	<pre>
	When "SALUTE" is given, raise your right hand smartly in the most 
	direct manner until the tip of your forefinger touches the lower 
	part of the headdress above and slightly right of your right eye. 
	Your fingers should be extended straight and joined with the 
	thumb along the forefinger. You should be able to see your entire 
	palm when looking straight ahead. Your upper arm should be parallel 
	with the deck with the elbow inline with the body and your forearm 
	at a 45-degree angle.  Your wrist and hand should be straight, a 
	continuation of the line made by your forearm. At the same time, if 
	not in ranks, turn your head and eyes toward the person or colors 
	you are saluting.</pre>
  
    	<p>This script attempts to track your joints and body parts to determine if you meet the requirement:</p>

    	<ul>
	    <li>Upper Arm is parallel to the ground</li>
	    <li>Forearm is at a 45 degree angle</li>
	    <li>Wrist and hand are in-line with the forearm</li>
	    <li>Palm is not visible</li>
    	</ul>
